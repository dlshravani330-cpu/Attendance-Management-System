# Attendance-Management-System
The Attendance Management System is a digital way to take attendance. It keeps a student database with name, ID, class, and contact. Teachers can mark attendance fast, and it saves the date and time. It makes daily, weekly, and monthly reports. Parents get alerts about absence, holidays, and timetables.
